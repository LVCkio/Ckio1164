During my internship at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED (CÔNG TY TNHH AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIỆT NAM)** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 9, 2025**, I had the opportunity to experience a highly professional, dynamic, and practical working environment.  
Throughout this period, I participated in the project **“Digital Transformation for Mini-Market on AWS”**, which involved designing system architecture, deploying a 3-tier model, applying cloud services such as Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, S3, CloudFront, IAM, and exploring CI/CD mechanisms.  
Through the project, I significantly improved my skills in **analysis, report writing, and teamwork.**

Regarding my working attitude, I always strived to complete assigned tasks well, follow mentor instructions, proactively communicate when encountering difficulties, and continuously learn to improve my performance.
