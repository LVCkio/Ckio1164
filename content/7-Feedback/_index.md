The assigned tasks closely relate to what I studied at university while expanding my knowledge in practical areas such as AWS Cloud, DevOps, and system architecture. This combination helps reinforce both theory and hands-on skills.

Throughout the program, I improved skills in teamwork, technical analysis, communication, and project management. The workshops and internal training sessions also provided valuable insights into real-world cloud practices.

### **5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is positive and respectful. Everyone supports one another, especially during high workloads. Despite being an intern, I always felt like a valued member of the team.
